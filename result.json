    "text": "Overview of Explosion Protection Techniques\n\nIECEx 2018 International Conference\n\nJakarta, Indonesia 8th and 9th August 2018\n\nInternational Electrotechnical Commission System for Certification to Standards Relating to Equipment for Use in Explosive Atmospheres (IECEx System)\n\nThe logo features the acronym \"BSNi\" with a stylized design incorporating blue, red, and green colors.\n\nBadan Standardisasi Nasional\n\nThe logo for the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC).\n\nThe United Nations emblem features a blue globe surrounded by 10 outstretched branches of olive leaves, symbolizing peace and unity.\n\nECON OPE\n\nThe image features a blue hexagonal pattern with various icons representing different aspects of the energy industry, including oil drilling, power generation, and transportation.\n\nINTRODUCING\n\nKarel Neleman\n\nTechnical Manager\n\nThe logo features the letters \"BSNi\" with a green semicircle to the right of the text.\n\nThe image shows two logos, one for \"IEC\" and another for \"IECEx,\" both associated with international standards organizations.\n\nThe emblem features the UN symbol, a globe with interlocking peace symbols, surrounded by the UN flag's blue background with white stars.\n\nA man in a suit stands with his arms crossed, smiling at the camera. The background shows part of a building with the word \"BARTES\" visible.\n\nThe logo consists of the word \"BARTEC\" written in bold, orange letters.\n\nWhy am I here...?\n\nPromotion of IEC and IECEx to be the one and only accepted certification system!\n\nTo achieve total ACCEPTANCE there’s a first need for CONFIDENCE.\n\nEach stakeholder needs to understand ISO/IEC based Types of Protection.\n\nLet’s start a quick guide:\n\nComponent Description Oxygen Necessary for combustion, typically present in air. Flammable gas A substance that can be ignited and will burn. Ignition source Something that provides the energy to start the fire, such as a spark or flame.\n\nA nighttime view of an industrial complex with numerous illuminated structures and pipes, likely a chemical or petrochemical plant. The scene is set against a dark sky with some clouds visible.\n\nIgnition sources\n\nHot surfaces\n\nFlames, hot gases, hot particles\n\nMechanically generated sparks\n\nElectrical equipment\n\nStray electric currents, cathodic corrosion protection\n\nStatic Electricity\n\nLightning\n\nRadio Frequency (RF) electromagnetic waves ≤ 300 GHz\n\nElectromagnetic waves > 300 GHz\n\nIonizing Radiation\n\nUltrasonics\n\nAdiabatic compression and shockwaves\n\nExothermic reactions, including self-ignition of dusts\n\nBSN)\n\nThe logo features the letters \"BSNi\" with a green semicircle to the right of the text.\n\nThe image shows two logos, one for IEC (International Electrotechnical Commission) and the other for IECEx (International Electrochemical Examiners).\n\nBadan Standardisasi Nasional\n\nIgnition sources IEC is commonly known as to deal with just Electrical Equipment. Be aware that we have today ISO/IEC working close together.\n\nNon-electrical equipment shall be assessed in hazardous areas as well.\n\nA 3D rendering of a pump system with a motor and a pipe connection. The pump is blue, the motor is also blue, and the pipe is yellow.\n\nSome basic knowledge is anyhow required.\n\nThe emblem features the UN symbol, a globe with interlocking peace symbols, surrounded by the UN flag's blue background with white stars.\n\nGas Groups\n\nGases are divided in sub groups because of: 1. Minimum Ignition Current / Energy 2. Maximum Experimental Safety Gap\n\nGas group Representative gas IIC Hydrogen, Acetylene, Carbon Disulphide IIB Ethene, Dimethylether IIA Propane, Petrol, Ethanole, Acetone, Acetaldehyde\n\nRemark:\n\n1st line (IIC) are most dangerous gases.\n\nThe logo features the emblem of the United Nations, consisting of a blue globe with intersecting white lines and the UN emblem at the center, surrounded by the organization's name in white text.\n\n<<\n\nComponent Symbol Inductor L Resistor R Capacitor C Voltage V\n\nTAEaADSUS ANOSPEERE\n\nComponent Description Interstice The space between two adjacent components in a circuit board.\n\nDust Groups\n\nDusts are divided in sub groups because of types of dust:\n\nDust group Types of dust Representative dust IIIC Conductive dusts Graphite Powder, Toner IIIB Non-conductive dusts Milk Powder, Powdered Sugar IIIA Fibers and Flyers Tobacco, Saw Dust\n\nRemark:\n\n1st line (IIIC) are most dangerous dusts (for IP rated electrical equipment) where IIIB is dangerous when there is possible electrostatic charge\n\nTemperature classes on equipment\n\nare applicable to gases and indicate the max. acceptable surface temperature\n\nT class Surface Temperature T1 450°C T2 300°C T3 200°C T4 135°C T5 100°C T6 85°C\n\nHow to read and use this table? When a site is classified as Zone 1 / IIA / T4 Hot surfaces become dangerous ≥ 135°C. For that reason all Ex equipment shall be selected having a T class T4, T5 or T6.",
