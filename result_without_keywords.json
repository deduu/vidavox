Conclusion. The attention generated from auxiliary learning could help the model\nlearn better by outputting what it is being processed in the middle of the network during\nbackpropagation. With the help of the attention block, the model could also produce a\nmore focused dot product in which each feature has its important region rather than the\noverall features. The extension is able to increase the base model (DenseNet) accuracy,\nprecision, recall, and F1 Score. The improvement over the DenseNet performance is 2%,\n1%, 1%, and 2% respectively on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. In the future,\nit is suggested to integrate ALAM on self-attention mechanism in a Visual-Transformers-\nbased model.\nAcknowledgment.

DenseNet [21] is a network that utilizes dense connections, whose idea\nis to concatenate the feature map of all previous layers to the subsequent layer in a\nblock. The dense connections allow DenseNet to reuse previous feature maps, which ease\nthe training process. DenseNet is also more parameter-eﬃcient than ResNet [22], which\nconnects only the output of the immediate previous layer. Figure 2 illustrates the inner\nworking of DenseNet.\nFigure 2. DenseNet architecture\n3.2. Auxiliary learning attention mechanism.Attention mechanism is usually im-\nplemented as a learned feature map that is multiplied element-wise to the ﬁnal feature\nmaps of a CNN. To model attention with the learned feature map, it usually goes through\na softmax or sigmoid activation function. Attaching an attention module only to the ﬁnal\nfeature maps limits the expressiveness of the model. However, attaching it to intermediate\nfeature maps leads to an architecture that requires gradient from earlier layers to pass\nthrough softmax/sigmoid function multiple times. Because the magnitude of the gradients\nis decreased at every pass, the model is prone to heavily suﬀer from vanishing gradient\nproblem.\nTo cope with this issue, we proposed an attention mechanism module that throws its\noutput to an auxiliary classiﬁer instead of passing it to the next layer. We call this atten-\ntion mechanism as Auxiliary Learning Attention Mechanism (ALAM). Figure 3 illustrates\nFigure 3. AuxNet",

PARDAMEAN\nour proposed model, where the attention modules are attached to the output of each block\nin a DenseNet architecture. ALAM uses a single Conv2D that outputs the same tensor\nsize as the input before going through the Sigmoid activation function which produces\nthe attention area. Each tensor will retain its own attention as each channel focuses on\neach of their features. The attention tensor will then be multiplied element-wise with the\noriginal input before going through a Global Average Pool. The dot product will then be\nconverted into a fully connected layer that will classify the image. The only block that did\nnot use attention is the last one as the network does not continue to another block after-\nward. The proposed network that uses ALAM is referred as AuxNet (Auxiliary Network)\nfor the rest of this paper.\nTo benchmark our proposed model, we compared it to a standard AlexNet that was\nused by Ibrahim et al. [9], a standard DenseNet, and a DenseNet with SE modules. All\nmodels used a pretrained ImageNet model to have beneﬁts from transfer learning. The\nlatter was used in the benchmarking experiment to test whether our proposed attention\nmodule is better than the state-of-the-art attention module. We employed the DenseNet\nwith SE modules introduced by Yan et al. [23], which enables the use of a pretrained\nDenseNet.\nIn the benchmarking experiment, we used a dataset of 400 images oil palm FFB images,\ncategorized into 7 ripeness classes. The distribution of images in the dataset is summarized\nin Table 1. The dataset was dividied into 3 groups for a typical CNN training procedure:\ntraining data (64%, 256 images), validation (20%, 80 images), and testing (16%, 64 im-\nages). To increase the variation in the dataset, all models were trained with Ten Crop, a\ndata augmentation procedure that can increase a dataset variation ten-fold. It works by\ncropping the top-left, top-right, bottom-left, bottom-right, and center part of an image\nto produce ﬁve diﬀerent images. These ﬁve images are also ﬂipped horizontally to obtain\nmore images.\nTable 1.Classiﬁcation of oil palm fruit\nName Description Total\nBP Ripening 16\nBM Raw 8\nKM Less Ripped 64\nMKM Almost Ripped 16\nM Ripped 96\nMM Perfectly Ripped 168\nTM Excessively Ripped 32\nTotal 400\n4. Results and Discussion.Table 2 shows the evaluation result of all models perfor-\nmance in the benchmarking experiment. It is clear that the models with DenseNet are\nsuperior from AlexNet. Interestingly, adding SE modules to the standard DenseNet re-\nduced the performance. This phenomenon can be explained by the fact that an SE module\npasses its output to the next layer, which has been exposed to a softmax function. This\ndesign allows the gradients of earlier layer to pass through several softmax function, re-\nducing the gradients magnitude for each pass. This leads to a vanishing gradient problem.\nContrarily to the SE module, adding ALAM module improved the performance of the\nstandard DenseNet. This was possible by the fact that ALAM escapes its output to a\nclassiﬁer instead of passing it to the next layer. This guarantees any gradients within the\nmodel to only pass an ALAM module once.\nTop-1 error rate and F1 Score are the evaluation methods used to measure the per-\nformance of all models proposed.

It is possible that modifying the architecture to be more suitable\nfor oil palm FFB classiﬁcation would result in a better performance.\nAmong the possible modiﬁcation for deep learning architectures, attention mechanism\nis the most promising to be applied. It is deﬁned as a module that lets the deep learning\nmodel strongly attend only part of the image to classify images, as illustrated in Figure 1.\nThis module is potentially suitable for oil palm FFB classiﬁcation, because the ripeness\nof the FFB can be determined only by looking at the color of the fruits, not the image in\ngeneral. Thus, the contribution of this study is to design an attention mechanism module\nthat can improve the accuracy of a standard deep-learning-based image classiﬁcation\nmodel for oil palm FFB classiﬁcation. The study is organized as follows. The background\nand related works are presented in Sections 1 and 2, followed by methodology in Section\n3. Section 4 presents the results and discussion, and Section 5 concludes the ﬁndings of\nthe study.\nFigure 1. Eggplant detection attention\n2. Related Works.Multiple researches have been conducted to develop deep learning\nmodels with attention mechanism. The ﬁrst attempt to apply the attention mechanism\ninto deep learning was done by Mnih et al. [11] for image classiﬁcation. The attention was\ngenerated via recurrent neural network, which is applied afterward to generate caption\nfrom an image [12]. For image captioning, two types of attention were developed: a\nsoft attention mechanism that generates continuous value as the attention and a hard\nattention that generates binary value as the attention. Inspired by this study, various\nattention mechanism modules were developed for computer vision cases such as image\nsegmentation [13], place recognition [14], medical image analysis [15], and also general\nimage classiﬁcation.\nSpeciﬁcally for general image classiﬁcation, the current most notable attention module is\nSqueeze and Excitation (SE) module. It injects a convolutional layer a capability to attend\nto its output feature maps channel-wise. In other words, it can be called as a channel\nattention. It successfully improved the accuracy of various standard Convolution Neural\nNetwork (CNN) for image classiﬁcation on ImageNet dataset. SE is extended by Woo et\nal. [16] with the addition of spatial attention module on top of the channel attention. The\nextended module is called Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM).\nNot only for computer vision, attention mechanism is also emerging for speech recog-\nnition [17]. It is even considered as a monumental breakthrough in natural language\nprocessing, with the formulation of self-attention [18], which gave birth to a new mod-\nel called Transformer. It is currently the base of almost all popular models in natural\nlanguage processing, such as Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers\n(BERT) [19] and Extra-Long Neural Network (XL-Net) [20].\n3.

Currently the available oil palm fruit ripeness classi\fcation models are lack-\ning in accuracy and reliability. As the consequence, the automation of oil palm fruit\nripeness sorting is not pervasive in the industry. This is unfortunate, because oil palm\nis one of the leading commodities in agriculture industry, especially in Indonesia. To\nimprove the accuracy, we propose a deep learning model with an addition-based attention\nmechanism as an oil palm fruit ripeness classi\fcation system. The result of this study\nshows that the proposed model improved the accuracy of the best previous deep learning\nmodel by 9.85%.\nKeywords: Oil palm fruit classiﬁcation, Convolutional neural network, Visual atten-\ntion, Computer vision\n1. Introduction. As a tropical country, agriculture becomes one of the largest indus-\ntries in Indonesia. Because of that, many researches have been conducted to improve the\nprocess of agriculture in Indonesia [1, 2]. Among the agricultural commodities, palm oil\ncan be considered as the most important commodity in Indonesia. In fact, Indonesia is\nthe largest oil palm exporter in the world [3]. Considering the importance of palm oil in\nIndonesia, an intensiﬁcation of palm oil production can signiﬁcantly boost the Indonesian\nnational economy. For that purpose, improving the oil palm Fresh Fruit Bunch (FFB)\nharvesting workﬂow is one of the most promising approaches. Currently, most of the oil\npalm plantations use manual labor within the harvesting workﬂow. Therefore, developing\nan automatic harvesting system can signiﬁcantly improve production productivity. One of\nthe tasks that can be automated in the workﬂow is FFB sorting according to the ripeness.\nThis task can be automated using a computer vision system that can classify FFB images\nbased on their ripeness [4].\nNoticeably, a robust automation of this task requires an advanced computer vision\nsystem, due to the complex appearance of a palm oil FFB. Several studies have been\nconducted to develop palm oil fruit classiﬁcation system using handcrafted color features\n[5, 6, 7, 8]. However, such approach is known to be error-prone. A slight diﬀerence in\nillumination between the real environment and the training dataset can degrade the per-\nformance of this approach signiﬁcantly. Thus, this approach is not ready to be deployed in\nthe industry. Fortunately, this problem can be solved by using a computer vision system\nbased on deep learning. This approach was started to be adopted for FFB ripeness clas-\nsiﬁcation, by employing deep learning architectures for general image classiﬁcation with\nDOI: 10.24507/icicel.17.12.1303\n1303",
